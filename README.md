# Java Programming 
More than C, Java has been the programming language that has peaked my interest in coding in
general. Obviously Java isn't going to be my primary language, and that's why this repo is a
one stop shop for all my Java personal and college projects (if any).
# CodeMaiden
CodeMaiden as a concept was just a location in my brain where I stored stuff related to coding. Now, it is still that, but it's also the name of my Git Repos. I totally don't have OCD.
