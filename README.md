# CodeMaiden - Primary
CodeMaiden is my primary repo for my College and personal projects for now.
This CodeMaiden is for Java. I might add projects from C or Ruby in the future.
All my code is up for forking and modifying. You don't even need to inform me cus it's not that
advanced of a code to fork anyway.
