# CodeMaiden
CodeMaiden is my primary repo for my College and personal projects for now.
This CodeMaiden is for Java. I might add repos for projects from C or Ruby in the future.
All my code is up for forking and modifying. You don't even need to inform me cus it's not that
advanced of a code to fork anyway.
# Why?
I'm currently in college, and naturally college programs are cr*p. I might add some programs in the near future related to college but until then, it'll just be my personal projects.
